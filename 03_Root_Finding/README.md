# 03 - Root Finding

This module covers numerical methods for finding roots (zeros) of functions. Root finding is fundamental to many computational problems and serves as an entry point to numerical methods.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Bisection Method
- Theory and convergence properties
- Bracketing methods concept
- Algorithm and implementation
- Advantages and limitations
- Error analysis

### 2. Newton-Raphson Method
- Taylor series foundation
- Derivation of Newton-Raphson formula
- Convergence criteria (quadratic convergence)
- Choice of initial guess
- Handling multiple roots

### 3. Secant Method
- Approximation of derivatives
- Two-point methods
- Comparison with Newton-Raphson
- Convergence rate analysis
- Practical applications
