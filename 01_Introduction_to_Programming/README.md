# 01 - Introduction to Programming

This module covers the fundamental concepts of Python programming, object-oriented design, and data visualization. It should serve as a foundation for all computational methods covered in later sections.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Python Basics
- Variables, data types, and operators
- Control flow (if/else, loops)
- Functions and modules
- List comprehensions and string operations
- File I/O operations

### 2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes and objects
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Encapsulation and abstraction
- Static and instance methods
- Practical design patterns

### 3. Data Visualization
- Matplotlib for 2D plotting
- Creating plots, subplots, and customizations
- Multiple plot types (line, scatter, bar, histogram)
- Saving figures and display options
